Brute Solution: search for the single element by iterating through array using two pointer, will take TC: O(N^2) and SC: O(1)

Some Optimization--> Use HashSet: Take one Hashset as it was given that their are one duplicate of each number except for one in array.
Start storing numbers in se, if duplicate found, remove original number also. 
This way when you iterate through whole array, you will be left with single number in set which will be our result.
TC: O(N)  SC: O(N)

Optimised: Bitwise XOR approach: TC: O(N),  SC: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            ans ^= nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
